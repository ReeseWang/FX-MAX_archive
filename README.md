# FX-MAX_archive

[FX-MAX](http://www.fx-max.com/) was a company with some digital audio related software products:

- **FX Teleport:** Offload VST/VSTi audio processing to other computers on the same network.
- **Giga Teleport:** Offload Giga Studio sampler audio generation to other computers on the same network.
- **Giga VST Adapter:** 'A tool allowing to use Giga Studio within any VST compatible host application (Cubase, Nuendo, SONAR, Logic, etc.) as a conventional VST instrument.'
- **FX Freeze:** Pre-render certain audio plug-ins at your choice, to free up computer resources for more polyphony or running more plug-ins. (Isn't that a common DAW feature already?)

The good thing is that they decided to give out their products for free when they 'went out of business'. I found Giga VST Adapter useful to me, to run Giga Studio without any GSIF-compatible audio hardware. So I decided to make an archive of their website on GitHub in case their website is gone.
